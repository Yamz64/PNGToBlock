# PNGToBlock
A tool that takes an image and generates a color coded image representing minecraft blocks that would best fit the sillouette

==========================================================================================================================================

PLEASE NOTE:

This tool can only process monochromatic (black/white) images with width and height that are multiples of 16 pixels.  The width and height
do not have to match for the program to work (16x32 is pefectly fine, but are still multiples of 16)

==========================================================================================================================================

To use this tool:

1) Compile the solution or use the provided release executable
2) Drag your executable into a folder and navigate to the folder using the command prompt
3) Enter the following command <Name of executable> <Input image filepath> <Output image name>
  
If everything has been done correctly you'll see the program start processing your image
